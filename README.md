### Hi there 🍄

* I am currently doing my PhD in Switzerland ⛰️🥾🧀🐄
* I am a biochemist who uses mass spectrometry to figure out proteins 🔬🧪
* I am interested in structural proteomics and all things related to mass spectrometry 🧬

Check out our R package [protti](https://jpquast.github.io/protti/) developed for easy data analysis of bottom-up proteomics and LiP-MS data 🤓💻
